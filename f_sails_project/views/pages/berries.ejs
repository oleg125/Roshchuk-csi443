                            Blackberries were perceived by the ancient cultures as being a wild plant, 
                            and historical accounts for a backyard culture of blackberry bushes are few.
                             The Greeks used the blackberry as a remedy for Gout, 
                             and the Romans made a tea from the leaves of the blackberry plant to treat various illnesses.

                                    Believe it or not, a few hundred years ago, all cultivated carrots were purple;
                                    the orange carrot wasn't cultivated until the late 16th century.
                                    It's unsurprising to see purple carrots sprouting up again given their stunning colour coupled
                                    with their anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidants.

                                        Radicchio looks like red cabbage, but itâ€™s actually a chicory family member. 
                                        This leaf is typically used for an accent in salads because of its steep
                                         cost as most radicchio lettuce arrives from Italy.
                                         Radicchio was first grown commercially in California in 1981.

                                  Purple potatoes, botanically classified as Solanum tuberosum, 
                                  is a general name encompassing dozens of heirloom and conventional varieties including Purple Peruvian,
                                  All Blue, Congo, Vitilette, and Purple Majesty. 
                                  Purple potatoes are grown in both domestic and commercial capacities and have recently 
                                  increased in popularity due to a market shift for antioxidant-rich foods. In addition to nutritional sustenance, 
                                  Purple potatoes are also used as a natural dye in fruit drinks, vitamin waters, and ice cream.

                                  Beetroot (sometimes called table beet, garden beet, red or golden beet, or just beet)
                                  is a taproot part of the beet plant. It is used for nourishment,
                                  but it also has use in food coloring and medicine.
                                  It can be used anywhere between raw to heavily processed.
                                  The red pigments in beets are called betalains.
                                  These strong antioxidants are present in each cell in the beetroot.
